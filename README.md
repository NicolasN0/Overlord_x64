In this project the focus was on building on top of an existing engine (overlord engine) that uses PhysX, DirectX and Fmod.

Starting of we added functionality to implement custom meshes, triggers and sound using fmod.
Next up was materials, shaders and sprite rendering.

This project also has added functionality for animations, taking into account bones and weights for skinned meshes.

To finish of the engine we added shadow mapping, particles, post processing and character controller implementations.

Testing out the engine a basic version of the game CrossyRoad was made.
